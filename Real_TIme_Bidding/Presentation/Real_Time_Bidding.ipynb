    "* RTB refers to the auctions are that are held for displaying an ad in the requested webpage in the time it takes to load that particular webpage. An example would be the sponsored search auctions displayed along with a google search.\n",
    "* Most of the market-places of RTB use *Second price auction.* The market-place for an RTB auction is called the **Ad Exchange.**\n",
    "* In such auctions, the bidder with the highest bid price wins the opportunity to show its ad, which is also called an **ad impression** and the winner is required to pay only the second highest price in the market.\n",

    "* A computer program decides which ad best suits the user along with the price a bidder should pay.\n",

    "\n",
    "Automated RTB is a highly dynamic process. In each auction, an unknown number of bidders will participate and the set of bidders varies over different auctions. It is almost a no brainer to model the participants of RTB as agents, as the bidders compete among themselves by offering competitive prices and the highest bid normally accepted by the seller is the one that maximises his/her profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goods:** The goods being auctioned are the various ad impression slots on the webpage and they aren't all identical. For example, the slot on the top of the page can be reasonably assumed to be of high price since there is more chance of the user seeing the ad.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agent 1:** *Supply-Side Platform (SSP)* \n",
    "\n",
    "* A program that is equivalent of a seller in the automated process.\n",
    "* They are designed by the publishers of the webpage with the goal of maximizing the prices their ad slots sell for by opening up ad impressions to as many potential buyers as possible during the real-time auction.\n",
    "* Some popular SSP's include OpenX, PubMatic, Right Media,...\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agent 2:** *Demand-Side Platform (DSP)*\n",
    "\n",
    "* The equivalent of a buyer in the automated process.\n",
    "* Designed by advertisers to buy impressions of ad slots across a range of publisher sites, but targeted to specific users based on information such as their location and their previous browsing behavior. \n",
    "* Some popular DSP's are Invite Media, MediaMath, DataXu,...\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goal of RTB\n",
    "\n",
    "The bidders are usullay constrained by their budget and this prevents them from bidding their estimation of the true values of an ad impression, which in general is the most optimal bid in second price auctions (aka Vickery Auctions). Owing to the constraint, to obtain an optimal bidding strategy in such a game with a large number of unknown participants is the major challenge in RTB.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make all the participants involved, *a goal of RTB is to deliver the right ads to the right users.* To understand this, consider the ads placed on a newspaper. Everyone with the newspaper, irrespective of their personal preference get the same ads. Cleraly, this isn't efficient. But the ads palced using RTB make use of the user information such as cookies from the browser to make personalized ad allocations thus maximising the chances of user interacting with the ad.\n",
    "##### Optimization Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the bidding is an automated process, DSP involved places bids under the budget constraint, with the target of maximizing Key Performance Indicators (KPI's) such as,\n",
    "* **Click-Through Rates:** represent the probability that the user will respond with the given ad-impression.\n",
    "* **Convesrion Rates:** How many such clicks resulted in web purchases or app installs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most algorithms follow *pay-per-click* pricing. That is, when a user clicks on the sponsored link, he is sent to the advertiser’s Webpage. The advertiser then pays the search engine for sending the user to its Web page. Hence CTR is a critical component of RTB. "
